Before we can really do anything with Coffeescript code that we write, we have to install the necessary components required to compile/run the Coffeescript code.  For this and following exercises I'll assume you working on an Windows machine.

Install Node.js:
Go to the Node.js website, nodejs.org.
Click the 'Download' button.
Select the Windows Installer from the pop-up box.
Execute the downloaded Windows installer from the downloaded location.
Follow the install wizard, the defaults are ok.
Use npm (Node.js package manager) to install Coffeescript:
Follow the steps above to install Node.js.
Open up the command line (start menu, run, cmd)
Execute the following command from the terminal (npm install -g coffee-script)
Test out the install:
Follow the steps above to install CoffeeScript the Node.js package manager.
type in the command "coffee" which should bring up the coffeescript intrepreter.
If that worked, you are done.
