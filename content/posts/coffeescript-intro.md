Now I want to focus on CoffeeScript, there was buzz in the development community, so I decided to check it out.  CoffeeScript is its own language, and "transpiles" to Javascript.  Transpilation here simply means that it's compiled into another high level language, rather then machine language or binary.  You might be wondering, what's the point in that?  CoffeeScript claims to be written with less code, and an average of 1/3 fewer lines.  It also adds syntactic sugar inspired by other languages, such as Ruby, Python, and Haskell to enhance Javascripts conciseness, and readability.

So, to put this to the test, I'm going to take an open source Javascript library, and port it to Coffeescript.  Then I'll run it through the CoffeeScript compiler, see the resulting output, and test out the resulting JavaScript.
