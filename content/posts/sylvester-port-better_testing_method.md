In the first part of the Sylvester port, towards the end of the segments, I introduced a crude method for testing, namely using alert calls to display the results of the previous operation. A better method be to use a testing framework.  Testing frameworks, have lots of advantages, repeatability, provide a set of methods for testing, and provide a reporting mechanism for successes and failures.  There is numerous frameworks out there for Javascript (see Wikipedia link below), but I stumbled on to one that has a feel of Junit, and its called Qunit.
